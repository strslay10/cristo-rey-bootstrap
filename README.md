# Website Redesign
The objective for this project is to re-design the Cristo Rey New York
website. Our redesign should leverage Bootstrap CSS and should be responsive
so that it looks great on any screen size.

### Template
The basic Bootstrap template in this repo was taken directly from the Bootstrap
docs page. [Template](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#template) I 
have included a few extra items such as custom css and custom javascript to
help get you started
